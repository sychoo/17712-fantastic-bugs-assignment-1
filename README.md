## 17712 Fantastic Bugs Assignment 1
### A collaborative project by Catarina Gamboa and Simon Chu

## Goal
We ran analysis using Infer static analyzer on two target programs, Clojure programming language and JUnit.

## Directories
`clojure-infer-output/`: all the infer output from running analysis on Clojure.
`junit-infer-output/`: all the infer output from running analysis on JUnit.
`reports/`: aggregated `reports.txt` from both of the infer outputs.
